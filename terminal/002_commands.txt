Listing files

ls: list files.
    =>shows all the files in the current directory.

pwd: print working directory.
    =>shows the current directory.

clear: clear the terminal.

Navigation commands: To move in and out of directories.

cd: change directory
    to get inside a sub directory: cd <directory name>
    to get out of a sub directory: cd .. => back button
    Note: using slash we can implement same thing multiple times.
    eg: cd ../../ => go back two directories.
    cd / => go to root directory.
    cd ~ => go to home directory.
    cd - => go to previous directory.

making directories:

mkdir: make directory
    eg: mkdir <directory name>

    If already directory exists, it will throw an error. We can also use absolute path to create a directory.
    eg: mkdir desktop/nazeer/newdir

flags: These are characters that we pass with commands to modify there behaviour. We can also combine multiple flags.

    eg: ls-l => l is a flag. It gives detailed info about the files.
        ls -a => a is a flag. It shows all the files including hidden files.    
        ls -la => shows all the files including hidden files in detailed format.

man: manual command gives info about the particular command.

    eg: man ls => gives info about ls command.

creating files:

touch: creates a file.
    eg: touch <file name> (with extension.)

    If already file exists, it will throw an error. We can also use absolute path to create a file.It is used to update the timestamp of a file. It's advisable to use extension with the file name.

    eg: touch desktop/nazeer/newfile.txt

deleting files and folders:
 
These are very sensitive commands coz, once the files are deleted we can't get them back.We should be careful while using these commands.

rm: remove files, it doesnot work on directories.
    eg: rm <file name>
    we can also remove multiple files at once 
    eg: rm <file name1> <file name2> <file name3>

rmdir : removes empty directories, it doesnot work on directories that contains some thing.
    eg: rmdir <directory name>

rm-rf : removes directories that contains some thing without asking. (rf-> recursice force)
    eg: rm -rf <directory name>
