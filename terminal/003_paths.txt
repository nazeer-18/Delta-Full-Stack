absolute : it will be relative to the root of the server . It starts with a slash

relative : it will be relative to the current location. It starts with name of the directory

eg: cd /users/user/desktop  ->absolute
    cd desktop ->relative

Absolute path is always better because it is more specific and it will always work.Relative path may not work if you are in a different directory.

/ -> root directory => all the other directories are inside the root directory even if we have multiple users all the users are inside the root directory.  
cd / -> go to root directory

~ -> home directory => each user has a home directory
cd ~ -> go to home directory
