Semantic markup is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the content rather than its appearance. For example, instead of using a div element with a class of "header" to create a header section, you would use the header element. This makes the code more readable and maintainable, and also helps with accessibility and search engine optimization.

Some examples of semantic elements in HTML5 include header, footer, article, section, nav, and aside. These elements provide a clear structure to the content of a webpage, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand.

Overall, using semantic markup is a best practice in web development that can improve the quality and usability of your website.

Advantages of Semantic Markup:
meaningful/layout structure
SEO friendly (search engine optimization)
Readable and maintainable code
