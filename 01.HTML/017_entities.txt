HTML Entities:

A Entity is a string that starts with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). The most common entities are:
&lt; - less than
&gt; - greater than
&amp; - ampersand
&copy; - copyright
&nbsp; - non-breaking space
