Strings are immutable in java , i.e on applying any method on string it doesn't gets affected in the original string.

Methods actions that can be performed on objects.
Format: stringName.method()
Example: "Hello World".toUpperCase() // "HELLO WORLD"

Trim: Returns a new string by removing whitespace from both ends of a string. It doesn't remove whitespace between letters/ words.

ex: 
    let str = "   Hello World   ";
    console.log(str.trim()); // "Hello World"
    console.log(str); // "   Hello World   "
