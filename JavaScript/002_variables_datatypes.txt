A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value.

Data types: The type of data that can be stored in a variable.

JavaScript provides 7 primitive data types.
String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, Bigint

Number: Any(positive,negative,decimal): 4, -8, 23.42, 0, -2.56.
  
Numbers has a limit of 16 digits only.If you enter more than 16 digits, the number will be rounded off to nearest number.

Boolean: true or false

String: sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

ex: "Hello", 'World', "123", 'true', " ", "Hello World"

string index: Each character in a string has an index. The index starts from 0.(similar to other programming languages).

length: property of string that returns the length of the string.
syntax: string.length
ex: "Hello".length -> 5

concatenation: joining of two or more strings.
syntax: string1 + string2
ex: "Hello" + " " + "World" -> "Hello World"

undefined: It is a special value that is assigned to a variable that is not initialized.

null : It is a special value that is assigned(intentional) to a variable whose value is empty.

ex: let a = null;

JavaScript automatically detects the data type of the value stored in a variable.

typeof : operator that returns the data type of the value stored in a variable.

ex: a = -10.87 b = "Nazeer"
typeof a -> number
typeof b -> string

We can change type of data stored in a variable simply by assigning a new value to it.

Declaring a variable: var, let, const

let: used to declare a variable whose value can be changed.

ex: let a = 10;
    a = 20;
    console.log(a); -> 20

If any variable is not initialized, it will be undefined.

const: used to declare a variable whose value cannot be changed.

ex: const a = 10;
    a = 20;
    console.log(a); -> error

var: used to declare a variable whose value can be changed. (similar to let)

comment: used to add a comment to the code. It will not be executed.

ex: // This is a comment

Identifiers: The name given to a variable is called an identifier.

Rules for naming an identifier:
1. It should start with a letter, underscore(_) or dollar($).
2. It can contain letters, digits, underscore(_) or dollar($).
3. It cannot contain keywords.
4. It cannot contain spaces.
5. It is case sensitive.

camelCase: It is a naming convention used to name identifiers. It starts with a lowercase letter and every word after that starts with an uppercase letter.

ex: firstName, lastName, myAge, mySalary

JavaScript by convention uses camelCase to name identifiers.

Python uses snake_case to name identifiers.

Java uses PascalCase to name identifiers.
